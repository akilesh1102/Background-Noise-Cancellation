# Background-Noise-Cancellation-using-LMS-and-DWT-algorithms.
This project ultimately focuses on noise cancellation of ECG signals and mainly the real time signals. Here the tool I used is MATLAB Simulink. The detailed explanation of  my project is included and equivalent project files were pushed for your work.

The adaptive filter architecture is designed for 4 tap and 8 tap with known reference input using LMS algorithm for known reference input. The LMS filter for unknown reference input is designed using DWT architecture and the results are obtained with cancellation of noise for both real time signal and ECG signal. Here we used Symlet wavelet decomposition method and designed architecture to obtain the speech and noise from raw signal. There is other 3 types are available which can be designed for finding which is optimized and efficient one and RLS algorithm other advanced algorithm can be used to get better results than LMS which we left for future work. It is likely that new applications for adaptive filters will be developed in the future. This implies that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the cost of
implementation of adaptive systems .The proposed continuation of this work is to build a prototype of the ANC using the modified LMS algorithm or other advanced algorithms.
The program would be converted to C programming language or any other programming language compatible with the controller.
